### GF Pancakes gluten-free:breakfast

Ingredients | Amount | Unit
Multi purpose GF Flour | 1.5 | cups
Buttermilk  | 1.5 | cups
Butter | 2 | tbps
Sugar | 1.5 | tbps
Baking Soda | 1/2 | tsp
Baking Powder | 1 | tsp
Salt | 1/2 | tsp
Egg | 1 |

1. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt.
2. Melt butter.
3. Mix milk and egg.
4. Once butter is cooled, mix butter to milk and egg mixture.
5. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients.
6. This GF Flour has xanthan gum, so keep adding butter milk until it becomes like a mucous consitency. It won't be as liquidy as normal pancake batter.
7. Cook on medium-low heat. Make sure inside is fully cooked, gf is weird. Once it has good crust, I like to keep it on low heat to continue cooking the inside.
