### Spaghetti Carbonara italian:pork:pasta

Ingredients | Amount | Unit
Spaghetti | 1 | pound
Eggs | 4 |
Egg yolks | 2 |
Pancetta | 8 | oz
Pecorino Romano, grated | 1 1/2 | cups
Black pepper, freshly ground | 2 | tsp

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook spaghetti according 
   to package directions until al dente.
2. While pasta cooks, cut pancetta into small cubes and fry in a large 
   skillet until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.
3. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, egg yolks, and most of the cheese 
   (save some for garnish).
4. When pasta is done, reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.
5. Add hot pasta to the pancetta pan (off heat) and quickly toss.
6. Add egg mixture and toss vigorously, adding pasta water as needed 
   to create a creamy sauce. The residual heat will cook the eggs.
7. Season with black pepper and serve immediately with remaining cheese.
